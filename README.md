Developed a website for immigrants in Canada to search for their favorite cultural foods and be suggested similar alternatives available to make in Canada that are more accessible and healthier. According to Statistics Canada, 26% of immigrants in Canada have diet-related diseases like Type-2 diabetes and heart disease. This website will help significantly reduce this number. Another feature this website has is that you are able to select the Canadian province you are in and search for restuarants that serve your favorite cultural meals. The goal of this is to bridge the cultural food accessibility gap in Canada. As of now, data is only available for African foods and within Western Canada (BC, Alberta, SK) but the long-term goal for this site is to expand and make it available to all who require it. You can create an account to store your personal-health goal and keep track of your searches. Some meals you can currently search for to find alternatives and restaurants near you are: jolofrice, akara, fried rice, amala, pounded yam etc. Please contact for any questions and enjoy! The link to the site it as follows: https://healthyeatsnutrition.netlify.app/
